So you've been (perma?)pearled!
===============================

Don't panic, and don't quit! Being pearled is a natural and inevitable part of the civ server experience. It may feel like the end, but in many ways it can be the beginning. Take heart and soldier on.

What is being pearled? It means that someone owns an enderpearl that has "captured" you. You can be freed in the following ways:

1. The pearl is dropped to the ground and left to despawn
2. The person possessing the pearl in their inventory does /ep free
3. The chest containing your pearl runs out of obsidian -- the owner of your pearl has to keep it "fed" by placing obsidian in the chest with the pearl(s).

For more on the specific mechanics, see [the ExilePearl repo](https://github.com/DevotedMC/ExilePearl). You can still play "normally", but within the bounds of many restrictions.

## The Bad

So, first off, the bad news. Here is a list of things you cannot do:

* Chat in global chat -- you must use groups or /msg people directly.
* Harm/kill other players.
* Harm/Kill "friendly"/passive mobs. Unfortunately due to a ~~bug~~feature, this includes any mobs with lore -- i.e. higher-tier mobs. These are higher-power baddies you'll see with "T1-T3" in their name. If you see them, do not engage. This also includes skeleton horses and the baddie skeletons they spawn profusely. Avoid at all costs.
* Place water or lava buckets
* Come within 1000 blocks of your pearl's location (so no, you can't free yourself)
* Set a bed -- that's right, every time you die you randomly respawn on the map.
* Start fires
* Use potions (including booze, how cruel)
* Break citadel-reinforced blocks
* Place snitches or noteblocks
* Place or damage bastions

Phew, that's a lot! Brace yourself, it gets worse:

## The Ugly

People can place a block called a claims bastion. This is a block that does many things, one of which is prevent by default the entry of any exiled player *unless* you are added to the group that the bastion is reinforced under. If you are exiled and you enter the field (a 100m circle), you start taking damage quickly until dead. Unfortunately for you, claims bastions are relatively cheap and they are now pretty much everywhere on the server. If you get invited to a town, assume you can't go, because it's bastioned. You will need to ask them to add you to the bastion group, and in all honesty, they will probably refuse.

## The Good

So, it's the end of the world, right? Not necessarily. There are some upsides:

* Suicide is your friend. Not being able to set a bed means relatively little downside to killing yourself to respawn elsewhere. See the world! Make friends! Die in bastion fields! This is a good opportunity to see parts of the map you've never seen.
* People are understandably wary of exiles, but if you can remind them that you are harmless (physically anyway), they tend to be a little friendlier.
* With all this newfound free time on your hands, you can grind pretty much endlessly. Let your autism flow!

## Tips and Tricks

There are some tips/tricks you learn along the way:

* Harvest ice blocks with silk touch. You can place and break these with a normal pick to effectively place a water source block without a bucket.
* Use your minimap to waypoint channels between bastion fields. Travelling is *hard* these days with bastions (like, really hard), but don't let that stop you.
* Being pearled means, duh, you can't be pearled again -- this is hard to internalize at first, but it empowers you with a bit of invincibility. Harness this! Confront raiders, harass your enemies. Show them you can't be bullied because you have nothing left to lose.
